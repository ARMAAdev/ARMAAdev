# Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is AbdulRahman and I'm a final year Computer Engineering student with a passion for all things AI, celestial, and quantum. 

## ðŸš€ About Me 

I'm currently diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence, with a particular interest in how AI can help us understand and explore the vast expanse of outer space and improve the biomedical field. 

At the same time, the quantum world has its hold on me. Quantum entanglement, to be specific, and how it could revolutionize the way we communicate and compute, fascinates me.

When I'm not contemplating the mysteries of the universe or unraveling the complexities of neural networks, you can find me enjoying a good combat sports match. 

## ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning 

Though my GitHub profile might seem a bit barren at the moment, it's not a reflection of my work. I'm currently working on several projects, and I can't wait to share them with the world.  

## âš¡ Fun fact 

Did you know that AI technology is being used to map the moon's surface and aid in future lunar missions? Talk about a perfect blend of my interests! 

## Thanks for stopping by, and may the code be with you!
